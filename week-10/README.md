- Question(pcheng14-stat6250):When the raw data file contains data that is free-format?
- Question (nshrivastava2-stat6250): list input causes SAS to scan the input lines for values rather than reading from specific columns. When the INPUT statement is submitted for processing, the input pointer is positioned at column 1 of the raw data file.
- Answer(nshrivastava2-stat6250): SAS reads the first field until it encounters a blank space. The blank space indicates the end of the field, and the data value is assigned to the program data vector for the first variable in the INPUT statement.Next, SAS scans the record until the next nonblank space is found, and the second value is read until another blank is encountered. Then the value is assigned to its corresponding variable in the program data vector.

- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): What must you remember when using list input?
- *Answer* (shatcher4-stat6250): List input, by default, does not specify column locations; therefore, all fields must be separated by at least one blank or other delimiter, fields must be read in order from left to right, and you cannot skip or re-read fields.
- *Question*(kamirneni-stat6250): Can range of variables be specified using formatted input?
- Question(pcheng14-stat6250):When the raw data file contains data that is free-format?

- *Question* (sbagdi-stat6250): What are some of the limitations of LIST input?
- *Answer* (sbagdi-stat6250): LIST input places several restrictions on the type of data that can be read:
Character values greater than 8 characters gets truncated. Data has to be standard numeric or character format. Character values cannot contain embedded delimiters. Missing values must be repreented by a period or some other character. 
- *Question* (who7-stat6250):How can i include the space without it being counted as a seperator?

- *Question* (ldai4-stat6250): How does the list input read the values with free-format?
- *Question* (sbagdi-stat6250): When should we specify the range of variables in SAS? Does it make a difference if we specify the range in VAR statement with PROC PRINT step rather than in the INPUT statement?
- *Answer* (sbagdi-stat6250): When the variable values in the raw data file are sequential (specially, if the variables are similar) and are separated by a blank or any other delimiter, we can specify a range of variables in the INPUT statement.
